# Python-Projects
ðŸ’» Python Projects (Assignments from my coursework at NAIT):

1. IPv4 Address Validation:
Objective:
Validate an IPv4 address entered in dotted decimal format. Ensure proper input handling, display validity, and allow users to exit the program by typing "quit".
Key Deliverables: Flowchart illustrating the validation process. Python program implementing the validation logic with clear documentation.

2. Advanced IPv4 Address Validation:
Objective:
Enhance IPv4 validation by supporting flexible separators (periods, spaces, commas). Include functionality to determine the address class, generate a binary representation, and display detailed information. Modularize the code with at least four functions (e.g., getip(), validateip(), errormessage(),showipinfo()).
Key Deliverables:
â€¢Python program with modular, structured, and well-documented code.
â€¢File Management: Tools for file operations and organization.

â€¢Command Line Argument inspect: Handling files through command-line arguments.

4. File Processing with Command-Line Arguments
   
Objective: Create a Python program to read, modify, and write file content based on command-line arguments. Handle file existence, default directories, and user interactions for overwriting files or creating new ones.

Key Deliverables:
Python program with modular code.

â€¢ Features include:

â€¢ Generating file headers with system info, username, and timestamp.

â€¢ Writing prefixed content to an output file with error handling.

â€¢ Video showcasing program functionality.
