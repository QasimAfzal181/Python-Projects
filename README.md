# Python-Projects
ðŸ’» Python Projects (Assignments from my coursework at NAIT):

1. IPv4 Address Validation:
Objective:
Validate an IPv4 address entered in dotted decimal format. Ensure proper input handling, display validity, and allow users to exit the program by typing "quit".
Key Deliverables: Flowchart illustrating the validation process. Python program implementing the validation logic with clear documentation.

2. Advanced IPv4 Address Validation:
Objective:
Enhance IPv4 validation by supporting flexible separators (periods, spaces, commas). Include functionality to determine the address class, generate a binary representation, and display detailed information. Modularize the code with at least four functions (e.g., getip(), validateip(), errormessage(),showipinfo()).
Key Deliverables: Python program with modular, structured, and well-documented code. File Management: Tools for file operations and organization. Command Line Argument inspect: Handling files through command-line arguments.
