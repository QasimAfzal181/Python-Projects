# Python-Projects
ðŸ’» Python Projects (Assignments from my coursework at NAIT):

1. User Input with Error Detection
Objective:
â€¢ Prompt users to enter two numbers and handle invalid input gracefully.
â€¢ Display the smaller and larger number after comparison.
â€¢ Allow users to type "quit" to exit the program.

Key Deliverables:
 â€¢ Flowchart in Visio.
 â€¢ Pseudocode matching the flowchart.

2. IPv4 Address Validation:

Objective:
â€¢ Validate an IPv4 address entered in dotted decimal format.
â€¢ Ensure proper input handling, display validity, and allow users to exit the program by typing "quit".

Key Deliverables:
â€¢ Flowchart illustrating the validation process.
â€¢ Python program implementing the validation logic with clear documentation.


3. Advanced IPv4 Address Validation
   
Objective:

â€¢ Enhance IPv4 validation by supporting flexible separators (periods, spaces, commas).
â€¢ Include functionality to determine the address class, generate a binary representation, and display detailed information.
â€¢ Modularize the code with at least four functions (e.g., getip(), validateip(), errormessage(), showipinfo()).

Key Deliverables:
â€¢ Python program with modular, structured, and well-documented code.
â€¢ File Management: Tools for file operations and organization.
â€¢ Command LIne Argument Parser: Handling files through command-line arguments.

4. File Processing with Command-Line Arguments
Objective:
 â€¢ Create a Python program to read, modify, and write file content based on command-line arguments.
 â€¢ Handle file existence, default directories, and user interactions for overwriting files or creating new ones.

Key Deliverables:
â€¢ Python program with modular code.
â€¢ Features include:
â€¢ Generating file headers with system info, username, and timestamp.
â€¢ Writing prefixed content to an output file with error handling.
â€¢ Video showcasing program functionality.


5. Py to Exe:
Objective:
â€¢ Develop a Python program that takes one or more command line arguments, prompts the user for something, does some calculations or processing, and writes a file.
â€¢	This program must be converted to and function as an executable.

Key Features:
â€¢ Command-Line Arguments: Accepts input file paths and output file paths as command-line arguments.
â€¢ User Interaction: Prompts the user for additional input, which modifies the content of the input file or affects calculations.
â€¢ File Processing: Reads content from the input file, processes it based on user input, and writes the result to an output file.
â€¢ File Writing: Includes error handling for file existence and writes content with a timestamp and system info in the header.
â€¢ Executable Conversion: The Python script is converted into a standalone executable file using PyInstaller for cross-platform compatibility.
