💻 Python Projects (Assignments from my coursework at NAIT):


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. IPv4 Address Validation:
   
Objective:

• Validate an IPv4 address entered in dotted decimal format. Ensure proper input handling, display validity, and allow users to exit the program by typing "quit".

• Key Deliverables:

• Flowchart illustrating the validation process.

• Python program implementing the validation logic with clear documentation.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Advanced IPv4 Address Validation:
   
Objective:

• Enhance IPv4 validation by supporting flexible separators (periods, spaces, commas).

• Include functionality to determine the address class, generate a binary representation, and display detailed information. Modularize the code with at least four functions (e.g., getip(), validateip(), errormessage(),showipinfo()).

Key Deliverables:

• Python program with modular, structured, and well-documented code.

• File Management: Tools for file operations and organization.

• Command Line Argument inspect: Handling files through command-line arguments.

3. File Processing with Command-Line Arguments

Objective: 

• Create a Python program to read, modify, and write file content based on command-line arguments. 

• Handle file existence, default directories, and user interactions for overwriting files or creating new ones.

Key Deliverables:

• Python program with modular code.

• Features include:

• Generating file headers with system info, username, and timestamp.

• Writing prefixed content to an output file with error handling.
